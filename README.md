Synopsis

UndercounterLights.ino: An Arduino controlled DotStar LED string. Both a PIR sensor and light sensor are required.

Motivation

This project provides smart undercounter lighting. A PIR motion sensor is used to detect motion and a light sensor determines if it dark enough to light the LED strip.

Installation

Download the INO file to your Sketchbook directory and run the Arduino IDE to download and program to the target processor. Refer to the schematic <<<< UNDER CONSTRUCTION >>>>

API Reference

This program uses the Arduino API. This program requires the FASTLED library which may be obtained via the Arduino website. It has been tested on the Arduino Micro

Tests

The code comes with a built-in self test than can be activated by setting pin 6 on the Arduino Micro LOW
